# CSDataStructures
The purpose of this repo is to help myself brush up and grow my cs core 


## How to use this repo
1. I'm doing this for learning purposes, I try to stick to best practices, 
however this is not going through rigorous testing, I'm not thinking about concurency or other types of issues 
and I'm not running this through any kind of CI or enforcing any build requirements (IE: I'm not enforcing code coverage, 
I may forget to run unit tests before checking in etc.)
2. Feel free to pull it as is or:
    * You are welcome to fork and change it how you see fit
3. Want an enhancement? 
    * I'm happy to hear enhancement requests however the fastest way to add an enhancement is to code it and submit a pull request
    * if you submit a PR, make your code is easy to read and understand. Be sure to include unit tests
4. I welcome constructive critism and feedback - it helps us all learn
