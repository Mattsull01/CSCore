### Sorting
Quick Sort<br>
Merge Sort<br> 
Other Sorts<br>

## Notes
* I try to stick to best practices, however this is not going through rigorous testing, CI or any build requirements, I'm not thinking about concurrency or other types of issues 
* I welcome constructive criticism and feedback - it helps us all learn
* I'm using XUnit to run and test the structures
